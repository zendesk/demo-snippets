# Community Roadmap for Zendesk Help Center

This project provides a public roadmap feature in Zendesk Help Center, where the product roadmap items are driven by community posts.

## Structure

The project is divided into two major modules:

The `backend` module is a REST API service built for hosting outside of Zendesk.

The `frontend` module is the  client of the REST API, built to run inside Zendesk Help Center, for instance as a Custom Page.

Each module has their own README file.
